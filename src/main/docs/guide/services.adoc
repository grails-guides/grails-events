Add a service which handles the registration of a user in the database. 

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/RegisterService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/RegisterService.groovy[]
----

<1> Annotate the method with `@Publisher`. The event Id uses the method name `saveUser`
<2> Raise an exception if the validation fails. This rollbacks the transaction. If the transaction is rollbacked, no event is triggered.

We consume the event in a different service. The consumer is completely decoupled from the sender.
In a real application you will probably send an email to the user who just registered asking him to verify his email address.
In this guide, we save a `Notification` in the database.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/services/demo/WelcomeEmailService.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/services/demo/WelcomeEmailService.groovy[]

<1> To consume an event use the https://async.grails.org/latest/api/grails/events/annotation/Subscriber.html[Subscriber] annotation. The method name `saveUser` is  used by default for the event id, although it can start with the word "on". In other words either a method name of `saveUser` or `onSaveUser` would work for the this guide example.
