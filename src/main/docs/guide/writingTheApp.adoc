Grails 3.3 introduces a new Events API that replaces the previous implementation that was based on Reactor 2.x (which is no longer maintained and deprecated).

In Grails 3.3 and above a new EventBus abstraction has been introduced. Like the PromiseFactory notion, there are implementations of the EventBus interface for common asynchronous frameworks like GPars and RxJava.

Your project already contains the events dependency:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
    compile "org.grails.plugins:events"
----

Grails Events capabilites documentation can be found in https://async.grails.org/latest/guide/index.html#events[async.grails.org].
